# raster-textures
## What?
PNG Graphic textures.
 
## Why?
I made all of this for Illustrator and Photoshop practise. Have plans to use them in my projects.

## Can I borrow?
Yes you can; unless you address it as your own work. It literally took hours of screen time to make them. Make sure to label, "Created by Shadow Scientist".
That's all. :)
